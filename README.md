# Laws-of-Reflection

A Puzzle Platformer game for the 148th [Weekly Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-148) with the theme "Mirror".

### Concept
The player controls two rectangles, mirrored vertically, and must get both to their individual goal. The catch: you control both rectangles with the same keys at the same time.
